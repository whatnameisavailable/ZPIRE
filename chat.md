# AI Interaction Overview  
During the development of Optimind, we used several AI tools to help us consolidate the idea and thus build a landing page.  
Here are the AI tools we used and their roles:  
* GPT-5: Brainstorming<br/>
* Copilot: Code generation<br/>
* Nano-Banana: Design of logo<br/>
# Prompting Details  
Here are some specific prompts we used to help with our landing page.<br/>
1. **Logo generated by Nano-Banana**<br/>
    Prompts:
   > Design a logo for an app contains the name: OPTIMIND, the app is about providing vision and cognitive functions screening, and personalized training especially for elderly.<br/>
   
   The logo generated contains a eye branching out as a brain and a human head, explained that the primary colour is blue that evokes trust and well-being. But we think the logo is too distant and professional looking, so we change the prompt:<br/>
   
   > Change the human to look like an elderly with a monocle. The feeling should be more friendly and kind. Change the colour from blue to a warm colour. The style changes to cartoon. <br/>
     
    The changed logo looks more suitable to be used as an app logo with all the elements we want to include.
  
2. **Brainstorming idea with GPT-5**<br/>
Prompts:
    >What colour can be used in a logo design to give a warm feeling?<br/>

    The reponse suggested many colour in warm side of the spetrum. For example, soft orange and coral: `#FF8A65`,`#FF7043`,`#FF6F00`
   This gives us ideas and wide range of colour choices to build our landing page in an attractive way.

   >I want to develop a simple test for elderly. What test formats can be used for improving memory?<br/>

   GPT-5 suggested many test ideas like Picture sequence recall and Story recall etc, offering text and audio. This is helpful when we are creating landing page as we can collect and comapre different presentations of tests, then inspire us to design our own tests used in OPTIMIND.

4. **Code generation by Copilot**<br/>
  Prompts:
    >Generate a code that can written in HTML. Design a card matching game displayed in 3*3. Randomly light up several number of cards as colour #F28C38 and count down 5 seconds for memorising. After 5 seconds, discolourize all cards and as user to select the cars pattern just shown.<br/>
    
    The response give a suggestion on coding for us to modify, make further advancements and use in our landing page in a convenient way

# Project Evolution

Our project grew step by step with practical help from AI suggestions, which guided us to make the product clearer, kinder, and easier to use for older adults.  

AI tools first helped us mix and match colors in a balanced, harmonious way. They checked contrast and readability and showed how warm tones create a friendly mood. After testing different palettes, we chose orange as our main color because it feels welcoming, stands out well on buttons, and keeps text easy to read when paired with light backgrounds and calm neutrals.  

AI also guided the design of our cognitive and vision tests for elderly users. It encouraged short, direct instructions, one task per screen, larger touch areas, gentle pacing, and clear progress markers. That is why the memory screen uses simple patterns and a clean step bar, and the vision screen uses a ring with an obvious segment to tap, reducing confusion and making the task quick to learn.  

In our codebase, AI showed better ways to write functions with plain names and straightforward logic, suggested smaller components, and flagged edge cases that cause errors. This made debugging faster and the app more stable on different devices, under low light, and with slow connections.  

AI also inspired us on the performance record features. It recommended saving scores over time, smoothing charts, and showing weekly change so trends are easy to see. Now clinicians can review a clear history for each user—memory, attention, and vision—and understand progress rather than just single results.  

To support users during tests, AI proposed a consistent help pattern: a small “?” button that opens short, scannable tips instead of long dialogs. This gives guidance without breaking the flow or adding stress.  

Finally, AI reminded us to keep every screen tidy and simple. It suggested larger fonts, high-contrast text, generous spacing, and fewer decorative elements, all focused on the easiness for the users to use. The result is an experience with warm visuals, clear tasks, stable code, meaningful progress tracking, and easy, lightweight help—built for older adults, and ready for caregivers and clinicians who need reliable, readable information.
